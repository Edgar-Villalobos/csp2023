<span>Hello my name is Edgar Villalobos, i am a freshman at Santa Ana HighSchool californina. I have not taken any courses like this before as this is my frist time doing this. I have not recieven or won any awards or achievements before. I wanted to take this course because i've always enjoyed using techonology and using google, but i never knew what goes into making these things so i figured i'd join and give it a try, and see what goes behind the scenes.</span>

  <li>Music</li>
  <li>Walking</li>
  <li>bike riding</li>
